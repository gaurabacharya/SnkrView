# SnkrView

SmkrView is an IOS application that allows users to upload a picture of sneakers to detect the type of shoe model and the machine learning model will
tell the user what sneakers they are. The application currently only detects Air Jordan Sneakers. 

This project was created for a Hackathon and our group won the sponsored competition by implementing our own machine learning model with HOT-G api on an IOS app.
