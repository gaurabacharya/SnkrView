# SnkrView

SmkrView is an IOS application that allows users to upload a picture of sneakers and the machine learning model will detect the type of shoe model and 
tell the user what sneakers they are. The application currently will only detect Air Jordan Sneakers. 

This project was created for a Hackathon and our group won the sponsored competition by implementing our own machine learning model with HOT-G api on an IOS app.
